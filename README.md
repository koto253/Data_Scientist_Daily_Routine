# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Olympics Dataset

This repository contains code and instructions for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Olympics dataset.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the Olympics dataset. The EDA steps include:

1. **Load the Dataset:** Loading the Olympics dataset (`olympics.csv`) to begin the analysis.
2. **Check for Missing Values:** Identifying and handling any missing or null values present in the dataset.
3. **Summary Statistics:** Calculating basic statistical measures to understand the characteristics of the data.
4. **Data Visualization:** Creating visualizations to explore the distribution of data and identify patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Analyzing correlations between different variables in the dataset to identify trends, outliers, and patterns.

## Files

- `olympics.csv`: Dataset containing information about Olympic events, including details on athletes, sports, countries, and medals.

## Usage

This project can be utilized in various Python environments and platforms such as:

- **Google Colab:** Upload the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to Google Colab for seamless execution in a cloud-based environment.
- **Python:** Execute the code in a local Python environment using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
